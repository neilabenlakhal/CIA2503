<!-- The on() method is a powerful event handling function in jQuery that can be used
 to attach an event handler function to one or more selected elements. 
 The main advantage of on() over other event handler methods like click(), submit(), keydown(), etc.,
  is that it allows you to attach event handlers to elements that are added to the page dynamically.

  The syntax of the on() method is as follows:

  
  $(selector).on(event, childSelector, handler);

  selector: Specifies the element(s) to which the event handler should be attached.
  event: Specifies the event type(s) for which the handler is being attached.
  childSelector: (optional) Specifies a child element that should trigger the event handler.
  handler: The function to be executed when the event is triggered. -->
