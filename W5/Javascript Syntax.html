/* Variables:
In JavaScript, variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords. 
The syntax for declaring a variable is: 

var variableName = value;
let variableName = value;
const variableName= value; // cannot be changed

var v = 10; //type Number
v = "web"; //type string
v= true;// type is boolean
let l = 10;
l = 4.5;//type float
var a=3.7;
const e = 30; // will always be equal to 30

/* Control statements are used to make decisions based on conditions in your code. 
The two most commonly used control statements in JavaScript are if...else and switch.
 */
    let f = 10;
    if (f > 5) {
       window.alert("f is greater than 5");
    } else {
       window.alert("f is not greater than 5");
    }

/*  Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. 
The two most commonly used loops in JavaScript are for and while loops.
 */

 for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  document.write(i+"<br/>");
}

/* An array is a collection of elements that can be of different data types,
 including numbers, strings, and objects. 
 To create an array, you use square brackets and separate the elements with commas.
 */

 let table = [1, "hi", 3, 4, 5];
document.write(table[2]); // Output: 3
table[2] = "four"; //String
document.write(table[2]);//output four
