CLO4: Create dynamic web applications using Node.js Modules and Frameworks
• Create Node.js modules and express code modularity in an application
• Introduce Express.js and HTTP request/response Objects.
• Build an HTTP server using the core modules in Node.js
• Create web forms on an HTML page and receive the data in a Node.js script on the server.
• Validate form data using Node.js module

What is node.js ?

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that 
allows you to build web applications using JavaScript. 
It was first released in 2009 and has since gained a lot of popularity in 
the web development community.
 Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine from Google, 
 which is also used in the Google Chrome web browser.

One of the main advantages of using Node.js for web development
 is that it allows you to use the same language for both the client-side 
 and server-side of your application. 
 This can simplify your development workflow and make it easier to share code 
 between the two sides of your application.

 Node.js also has a lot of built-in features for building web applications, 
 including an HTTP server, a file system module, and support for streams and buffers.


1- Setting up a Node.js environment

To get started with Node.js, you first need to set up a Node.js 
environment on your computer. Here are the steps you need to follow:

Download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website.

https://nodejs.org/en/download

Verify that Node.js is installed by running the following command in your terminal or 
command prompt:

node --version

Create a new Node.js project by creating a new directory and running the following command 
in your terminal or command prompt:

npm init

This will prompt you to enter some information about your project and 
create a package.json file in your project directory.

what is NPM ?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js and 
allows you to easily install and manage third-party packages and modules 
for your Node.js projects.

What is a module ?
In Node.js, a module is like a small package of code that performs a specific task,
 such as reading files, making HTTP requests, etc. 
 Modules help keep your code organized and can be 
 reused in different parts of your Node.js application, 
 making it more efficient and easier to manage.

NPM also allows you to specify dependencies for your Node.js projects 
in the package.json file (called also manifest). This makes it easy to share your projects 
with others and ensures that all dependencies are installed correctly
 when someone else tries to run your project.

 <!-- Create a new file called index.html with the following contents: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Node.js Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from Node.js!</h1>
    <h1> Another update from node!</h1>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Create a new file called server.js with the following contents:

// Import the built-in 'http' and 'fs' modules
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');

// Create an HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/') {
    // If the request URL is '/', read the contents of 'index.html' and send it as the response
    fs.readFile('./index.html', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        // If there's an error reading the file, send a 500 response with an error message
        res.writeHead(500);
        res.end('Error loading index.html');
      } else {
        // If the file is read successfully, send a 200 response with the file contents as the response body
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
        res.end(data);
      }
    });
  } else {
    // If the request URL is anything other than '/', send a 404 response
    res.writeHead(404);
    res.end('Page not found');
  }
});

// Start the server and listen for incoming requests on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});



Start the server by running the following command:  node server.js

access the page from : http://localhost:3000/
